This created a unique platform to companies for their advertising and branding activities and that also helped book to cover its associated printing and distribution costs. Thus, the small pocket sized booked scaled to a 250+ pages A3 sized handbook named “An Insight into Plastics” that has become an essential resource for industry professionals globally and aiding growth of plastics through information sharing.</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">Mr. Niranjan Dave took an initiative to gather essential
                                information’s, analyse it carefully and convert it into valuable technical insights,
                                ensuring clear and practical understanding for all. The task indeed was not easy but a
                                beginning was to be made. Mr Dave strongly believed that information is the most
                                important driver for innovations, empowering people and shaping a better future.</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Then he was in search of a platform to
                                distribute the book then ready to target audience, which was a small pocket size book
                                with less than 50 pages that explained the basic information on the most commonly used
                                plastic materials, forms and processes. Mr Dave soon got that opportunity at the first
                                launch of PLASTIVISION exhibition, Mumbai organised by AIPMA and it was there the first
                                edition of Plastic Technical handbook was published in 1992 and distributed FREE OF COST
                                to the visitors.</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">The technical handbook soon gained widespread
                                attention and recognition among industry professionals seeking information. Encouraging
                                positive reception and feedback was received for the act, that motivated, Mr. Dave to
                                publish 2nd edition of the Plastic Technical Handbook at the PLASTINDIA exhibition in
                                New Delhi in 1994, just two years after its initial launch. From that point ahead, the
                                plastic technical handbooks popularity continued to grow and was widely accepted and
                                highly regarded by the plastic industry, entrepreneurs, and students alike. With an
                                overwhelming response and support from key industry leaders, the book underwent regular
                                updates, ensuring it remained relevant and useful for its readers.</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s">The updated editions were regularly published
                                in conjunction with prestigious plastic exhibitions namely PLASTINDIA and PLASTIVISION
                                that are organised every 3 years in city of Delhi and Mumbai, INDIA to reach the hands
                                of target audience. During its journey, handbook was renamed “An Insight into Plastics”,
                                a name that reflects its commitment to education, innovation, and making plastic-related
                                complex concepts easy for everyone to understand.</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">As the book gained popularity and demand for
                                books increased, more copies were printed, leading to a rise in commercial activities.
                                Since Dave Technical Service (DTS) was primarily a manufacturing company, managing the
                                project and its commercial aspects efficiently required a dedicated entity. To
                                streamline operations, DAVE INFOMEDIA was established in September 2005. The Plastic
                                Technical Handbook brought to life the motto "Spreading Knowledge and Inspiring Growth."
                                and evolving over time it became a trusted guide for professionals and learners alike
                            </p>

                                borders to maximum people we also converted the print copy book into easy-to-read
                                plastic flip book version that can be easily shared by QR code or link and the book is
                                ready to be read on your cell phone, tab or laptops. The last 3 editions of 2018, 2020
                                and 2023 are available in plastics E book format apart from their hard copy versions.
                                The Technical handbook is published in a gap of 2-3 years, thereby offering multiple
                                circulations at different events that falls in that period and books also offer longer
                                retainership and visibility among target audience. This created a unique platform to
                                companies for their advertising and branding activities and that also helped book to
                                cover its associated printing and distribution costs.</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">In today society, packaging is pervasive and essential. Initial
                                packaging’s were natural objects like shells, gourds and leaves – used to contain food
                                and drink so that it could be consumed in a place away from where it was obtained.</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Packaging plays a vital role in terms of
                                protection, storage and hygienic handling of a product and it plays a key role in the
                                marketing mix. The product no matter how useful and of best quality and wonderful may
                                be, would not move the self if its packaging is not attractive and can efficiently
                                communicate to the buyers exactly about what the product can offer to them.</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">Packaging is the only tool to win in those
                                crucial few seconds that customers will spend perusing and debating over various brands,
                                model and flavours. The goods we buy undergo series of pre and post operation from
                                processing and manufacturing through handling and storage to the final consumer. Without
                                packaging, materials handling would be a messy, inefficient and costly exercise, and
                                modern consumer marketing would be virtually impossible.</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s">There has been persistent demand and request
                                to bring out a Technical Publication related to the packaging industry. The industry has
                                also been experiencing a long felt gap in respect of a single comprehended “source of
